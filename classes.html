            of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana<br>
            (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and guided meditation<br>
            to foster your mind and body connection.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Vinyasa Yoga</strong></dt>
        <dd>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome<br>
            to sample this 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized movement -<br>

      <dt><strong>Restorative Yoga</strong></dt>
        <dd>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses that are supported<br>
            by a chair or wall. This calming, restorative experience is suitable for students<br>

    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close<br>
       your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready,<br>
       roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands<br>
       in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
